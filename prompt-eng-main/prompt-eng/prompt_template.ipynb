    "# Prompt Template Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Template Prompting refers to a technique where predefined templates are used to construct effective prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) to generate responses tailored to specific use cases. The templates typically contain static text combined with dynamic input variables, allowing for consistent, reusable, and customizable prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt templates are widely used across various domains, such as:\n",
    "* **Question Generation**: Templates can generate quiz questions by filling in variables related to topics.\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Static instructions combined with variable documents or inputs allow flexible summarization.\n",
    "* **Coding Assistance**: Dynamic prompts help LLMs generate code snippets for different programming tasks.\n",
