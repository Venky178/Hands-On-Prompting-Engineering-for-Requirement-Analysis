# Research Question 
Exploring how cutting-edge AI prompting techniques can power a next-gen nutrition and fitness bot for smarter, personalized health guidance!

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic

AI-driven nutrition and fitness bots already leverage machine learning and rule-based algorithms to provide personalized health recommendations. Techniques like **Chain of Thought (COT), Tree of Thoughts (TOT), and Few-Shot Prompting** have been successfully applied in other domains (e.g., medical diagnosis, decision-making systems) to improve reasoning, personalization, and adaptability. Existing fitness apps use calorie tracking, workout suggestions, and general health insights, but **few truly break down reasoning step-by-step or explore multiple pathways dynamically**. Integrating **advanced prompting strategies** can make recommendations **more interactive, context-aware, and personalized** than ever before!

# Results

### **Results Achieved Through Research Process **  

Our research explored different AI prompting techniques for designing an intelligent **nutrition and fitness bot**, focusing on reasoning, decision-making, and personalization. Here’s a summary of key findings from each method:  

#### **1️. Chain of Thought (CoT) **  
- Enabled **step-by-step logical breakdown** of user queries (e.g., analyzing caloric needs before suggesting meal plans).  
- Improved **explainability** of AI-generated fitness/diet recommendations.  
- Ensured structured reasoning but required **longer response times**.  

#### **2️. Tree of Thoughts (ToT) **  
- Generated **multiple pathways** for each user goal (e.g., different diet plans for weight loss).  
- Allowed **comparative evaluation** of options (e.g., keto vs. intermittent fasting).  
- Required more **computational resources** to assess pros & cons dynamically.  

#### **3️. Contrastive Prompting **  
- Provided **direct comparisons** between choices (e.g., HIIT vs. steady-state cardio).  
- Helped users make **informed decisions** based on personalized factors.  
- Best suited for decision support but lacked deep step-by-step reasoning.  

#### **4️. Few-Shot & Zero-Shot Prompting **  
- Few-Shot improved **response accuracy** with prior examples, while Zero-Shot handled **new queries efficiently**.  
- Suitable for handling **general user queries** but lacked **deep reasoning or personalized guidance**.
